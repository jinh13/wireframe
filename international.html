<h2>Prepare for the USA</h2>
<p>The best way to prepare for the US is to talk to current WashU students. There are many WashU student volunteers who would be more than happy to introduce students to the WashU lifestyle -- please contact the Undergraduate Admissions Office at (314) 935-6000 to ask for a student volunteer!</p>

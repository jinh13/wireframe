<p>Move in Day might be one of the most stressful days this week because there is so much traffic, people, boxes, and choas! But let's reduce this choas by preparing for this day. Be sure to bring your own dolly and pack everything into boxes that can be easily carried on the dolly. Research where your dorm is relative to the drop off street so you can easily move into your dorm and save time.</p>

<p>Convocation is an event when all residential colleges come together to compete in various games and sports. Come cheer on your residental college (the affliation for your dorm) and bond with your dorm-mates through these hilarious obstacles! Prepare for this by getting pumped up and packing bandanas and crazy apparel in your luggage!</p>

<p>The Fall Activities Fair is the most useful event for freshmen looking to get involved on campus. All student groups come together to recruit students and introduce their clubs. It is a great time to meet new people with similar interests! Prepare for the Activities Fair by recognizing what types of clubs you would like to get involved in such as clubs focused on hiking, sustainability, women empowerment, community service, and so much more.</p>

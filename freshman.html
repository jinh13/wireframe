<p>Move in Day might be one of the most stressful days this week because there is so much traffic, people, boxes, and choas! But let's reduce this choas by preparing for this day. Be sure to bring your own dolly and pack everything into boxes that can be easily carried on the dolly. Research where your dorm is relative to the drop off street so you can easily move into your dorm and save time.</p>

<p>The Fall Activities Fair is the most useful event for freshmen looking to get involved on campus. All student groups come together to recruit students and introduce their clubs.

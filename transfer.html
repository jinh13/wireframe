<h1>Transfer Student</h1>
		<p>We want you to feel as comfortable as possible when you transition into a new college! Transfering schools can be stressful, and we also know that the most important way to feel home with a new college is to live on campus. To help chose which type of housing would fit with your personality best, here is a list of the on-campus options!</p>
